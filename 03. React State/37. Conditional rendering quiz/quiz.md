1. What is "conditional rendering"?
using conditions to determin what state of rendering the component should be. weither its text
or visablitiy.


2. When would you use &&?
if you try to make a conditional rendering or call


3. When would you use a ternary?
its up to preference you dont really need to uses either but ternaty looks a little more clean to me
for two option

4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on
   what to display?
add more ternaries or conditonal checks
